Features: Literally make an account with the user&pass you gave it...

How to use:

If you don't have Selenium installed already, search "run" in the Windows searchbar.
Open it, type "cmd" in it, then press enter.

Once the command prompt has opened, type in "pip install selenium"

Wait a bit for Selenium to install.

A few seconds later, you're good to go! Just extract the zip file into a folder whereever, and run the "main.py" file.

(also, don't worry I didn't do anything with the chromedriver.)
